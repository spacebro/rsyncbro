# rsyncbro

A simple app to rsync media to a remote folder

## ‚ùìWhy ?

It is a simple app written for the [spacebro
galaxy](https://github.com/spacebro/)

Sometimes you want all the media from a collection to be sent to a
remove computer.
rsyncbro sends all files to the same folder in the remote computer.
All you have to do is set the name of the remote computer in settings

Input media:

```
{
  path: '/home/user/photos/myphoto.jpg',
}
```

The app will attempt to copy the file to the server mentioned in
settings.destination at the same path. That would be the following rsync
command:

```

rsync -Paur /home/user/photos/myphoto.jpg destination:/home/user/photos/myphoto.jpg

```
